      <description>A cleansing hot shower or bath I like to start with taking a shower or a bath when getting ready for bed. I’ll always incorporate either Himalayan pink salt or Epsom salt into my routine. Then, I’ll do an in-shower meditation, just releasing my day and allowing it to wash down the drain. I like to start from the neck down to symbolize washing and removing anything, and then I go from the feet up after to symbolize recharging my energy.</description>
